# Castlerea
This page **"Castlerea"** is a website created as an information page for my local town.

Using this page you will receive information on things to do in the area, a gallery of images, and a contact section. The site has been created to bring more tourists to the area.

I created this website based on my hometown to bring in more tourists and to show what rural towns have to offer and what small towns in the west of Ireland are like.

I think the west of Ireland has so much to offer. Castlerea is an excellent example, as you will see from the information and images provided on the website.

I designed the website as a mobile view first. I then added breakpoints for different screen sizes.

  # Bugs and Fixes
 - **Home Page**
   - I was having issues with the position of the text on the hero image.
   - I solved this by adding different breakpoints.
 
   

  - **Gallery Page** 
    - I was having issues with the images on the gallery page having space at the bottom of the page.
    - I solved this by changing the height of some of the images at different breakpoints.

  - **Contact Form**
    - There was an issue where the "Age Range" was not required for submitting the form.
    - I used `<p>` in the beginning but, I switched it to `<label>` this solved the issue.
   
    - There was an issue with the position of the box for the form on different viewpoints.
    - I solved this by adding different breakpoints, so the box would be in the correct position.

    - The submit button was not sending the user to the page intended. The user was getting a "501 Error Code".
    - In the beginning  I used `method="POST"` When I switched it to `method="GET"` the issue was solved.

  - **404 Error Page**
    - I was having issues with my 404 page.
    - I had saved the page as 404-error-page.html. This was causing issues until I renamed the page 404.html.  I used [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site) page to help me.
    - The 404 page would not load when I would host it locally.
    - I fixed this issue by using the preview a page feature on Gitpod. This allowed me to fix my CSS code while viewing it, otherwise I would have to "Git push" every edit.

  - **General Bugs/Issues** 
     - The FavIcon was being displayed on my website when I would host it through Gitpod, but not through Github pages.
     - The reason for this was: I was missing the "`.`" before the "`/`" when I was linking the icons. The FavIcons were not placed in the assets folder. Once I changed this, It was working.
     - I used the American spelling "Gallary".
     - I changed it to "Gallery".
     - I used ".jpg" images in the begining.
     - I noticed this was affecting my lighthouse performance report. I changed the images to ".webp".
     - I was getting a poor performance score on my lighthouse restults.
     - I improved the score by compressing the webp images.
     - I was getting an error message on lighthouse for my footer because the icons did not have a name.
     - I added a `<span class="sr-only">` this solved the issue.



# Added Items
  ## **FavIcon**
  - I used FavIcon to add the logo to the top of the tab.
  - I used "CREA" as a shortcut for Castlerea.

  ![Fav Icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp9lxtk3y/image/upload/v1673822771/README%20Images/Gallery%20Photos/android-chrome-192x192_j4lo6z.png)

  ## **Cloudinary** 
  - I decided to switch from saving my images in an images folder to using Cloudinary.
  - I found this would benefit the performance of my website.
  - Check out [Cloudinary here.](https://cloudinary.com/ip/gr-sea-gg-brand-home-base?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=goog_selfserve_brand_wk22_replicate_core_branded_keyword&utm_term=1329&campaignid=17601148700&adgroupid=141182782954&keyword=cloudinary&device=c&matchtype=e&adposition=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_P6dBhD1ARIsAAGI7HBiqtoSkOp8dv2sdvprV-d3z6NkMdyK0guRRH98shquMJ7QiCtVbJQaAnvIEALw_wcB)

    ## **404 Error  Page**
  - I decided to create an Error Page for my website. I feel this adds to the website instead of having a plain 404 error page.
  - I based it the same as the other pages on my website. 
  - This mean the user has the option to go back to the home page of the website.
  - When the "Go Back!" text is hovered over, it changes from Green to Maroon.
  - The background image was taken from [here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/087%2C_Castlrea.jpg)
  - Check out the [404 Error Page.](https://clivec99.github.io/p1-castlerea/404.html)
