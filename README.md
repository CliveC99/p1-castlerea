# Castlerea
This page **"Castlerea"** is a website created as an information page for my local town.

Using this page you will receive information on things to do in the area, a gallery of images, and a contact section. The site has been created to bring more tourists to the area.

I created this website based on my hometown to bring in more tourists and to show what rural towns have to offer and what small towns in the west of Ireland are like.

I really think the west of Ireland has so much to offer, Castlerea is a great example as you will see from the information and images provided in the website.

I designed the website as a mobile view first and then I added breakpoints for different screen sizes.

  # Bugs/Issues and Fixes
 - **Home Page**
   - I was having issues with the postion of the text on the hero image.
   - I solved this by adding different breakpoints.
 
   

  - **Gallary Page** 
    - I was having issues with the images on the gallary page having space at the bottom of the page.
    - I solved this by changing the height of some of the images at different breakpoints.

  - **Contact Form**
    - There was an issue where the "Age Range" was not required for submitting the form.
    - I used `<p>` in the beginning but I switched it to `<label>` this solved the issue.
   
    - There was an issue with the position of the box for the form on different viewpoints.
    - I solved this by adding different breakpoints so the box would be in the correct position.

    - The submit button was not sending the user to the page intended. The user was getting a "501 Error Code".
    - In the begining I used `method="POST"` When I switched it to `method="GET"` the issue was solved.

  - **General Bugs/Issues** 
     - The FavIcon was being displayed on my website when I would host it through Gitpod, but not through Github pages.
     - The reason for this was: I was mising the "." before the "/" when I was linking the icons. The FavIcons were not placed in the assests folder. Once I changed this, It was working.

    - The 404 error page was not loading.
    - This was because I had named the file "404-error-page.html". When I changed the name to "404.html" txhe issue was solved.
   


# Added Items
  ## **FavIcon**
  - I used FavIcon to add the logo to the top of the tab.
  - I used "CREA" as a shortcut for Castlerea.
